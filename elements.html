										<h3 class="major">Project selection</h3>
                                        <p>Project selection was really critical for us and we spent a long time to select the most suitable one for us. As we are more interested in the subjects dealing with Prof. Biagi, we asked him to offer us some topics more than what were available on the course’s website.
											He kindly suggested two other topics; one related to GNSS and one related to OpenStreetMap database and ViaLibera?! Project. We selected the second one because it would help us to assess what ever we have learnt in terms of computer science and programming and also is a good opportunity to improve our skills in web development.
											After selection and confirmation, prof. Biagi sent us one paper and one thesis of his former student which was related to our project. We completely read them and made our decision to proceed with the topic</p>

										<p>Firstly, let us talk about ViaLibera?! Project.(you can find the complete documentation of this project on the following link: <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/IT:ViaLibera">ViaLibera</a>.</p>
											
										<p><strong>ViaLibera?!</strong> - Project for the mapping and evaluation of the accessibility of the Municipality of Milan 9.
											The project, which started in October 2018, foresees the verification and mapping of the accessibility of three large areas of City Hall 9 in Milan.1
											Now the project is on the middle of its way and we are going to push it forward one step.
											What we are going to do as our project for this course is to develop a website which depicts the progress of the objects mapping and tags insertion into the OSM2 database required for the ViaLibera?!project.</p>


										<h4>Scenario 1</h4>
										<blockquote>“ViaLibera?! Stakeholders want to launch several campaigns specially for high school students to go on the streets of the city and map the missing required items and measure some quantities of the sidewalks and crossings.
											They also use social media to encourage students to participate and also make some tutorials to teach them how to measure and how to insert data into the OSM database.”</blockquote>
										<h4>Scenario 2</h4>
										<blockquote>“Most of the students prefer to work together on field and meet each other when they are mapping.
											So, they are more likely to go to the areas of the city which are more attractive and are better places to gather together and have a coffee together as well.”</blockquote>
										<h4>Scenario 3</h4>
										<blockquote>“After a few days, all the required elements are mapped and all the relevant tags are inserted, but all of them are for a small area of the city because there is no tool to guide them through the project and let them know which tags or elements are already available in the OSM database.
											Also, the stakeholders cannot manage them and distribute them in different groups and assign an area to each group because they can not see the whole project in a glance.”</blockquote>
